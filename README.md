# RunPod Assistant

An AI coding assistant powered by RunPod serverless inference, built on [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai).

**Default model:** GLM 4.7 Flash via RunPod serverless endpoint.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) 1.3+
- A RunPod API key (get one at [runpod.io](https://runpod.io))

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd runpod-assistant-code
git checkout main
bun install
```

> **Important:** All current changes are on the `main` branch.

### 2. Set your API key

Export your RunPod API key as an environment variable:

```bash
export RUNPOD_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

Add this to your shell profile (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.) so it persists across sessions.

### 3. Run the assistant

```bash
bun dev
```

This starts the TUI. On first launch, you will be guided through the setup flow to configure your model and credentials.

To run against a specific directory:

```bash
bun dev /path/to/your/project
```

### Clearing stale config

If you previously ran the assistant on a different branch (e.g. `dev`) or with a different model, **you must remove cached config files** before running again. Otherwise the old model selection will persist.

```bash
# Remove global config (contains saved model selection)
rm -f ~/.config/opencode/config.json

# Remove saved auth credentials (if you want to re-enter your API key)
rm -f ~/.local/share/opencode/auth.json
```

After removing these files, restart the assistant with `bun dev` and go through setup again.

### Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Still seeing old model (e.g. Qwen) | Remove `~/.config/opencode/config.json` and restart |
| Never prompted for setup | If `RUNPOD_API_KEY` env var is set, setup is skipped (the key is used directly). Remove the env var to trigger setup, or just use the env var approach. |
| Model returns errors after branch switch | Remove both config files listed above and restart |
| 500 errors from endpoint | The endpoint has a ~30-40s cold start. Wait and retry. |

### Installation

```bash
# YOLO
curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash

# Package managers
npm i -g opencode-ai@latest        # or bun/pnpm/yarn
scoop install opencode             # Windows
choco install opencode             # Windows
brew install anomalyco/tap/opencode # macOS and Linux (recommended, always up to date)
brew install opencode              # macOS and Linux (official brew formula, updated less)
paru -S opencode-bin               # Arch Linux
mise use -g opencode               # Any OS
nix run nixpkgs#opencode           # or github:anomalyco/opencode for latest dev branch
```

> [!TIP]
> Remove versions older than 0.1.x before installing.

### Desktop App (BETA)

OpenCode is also available as a desktop application. Download directly from the [releases page](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/releases) or [opencode.ai/download](https://opencode.ai/download).

| Platform              | Download                              |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| macOS (Apple Silicon) | `opencode-desktop-darwin-aarch64.dmg` |

#### Installation Directory

The install script respects the following priority order for the installation path:

1. `$OPENCODE_INSTALL_DIR` - Custom installation directory
2. `$XDG_BIN_DIR` - XDG Base Directory Specification compliant path
3. `$HOME/bin` - Standard user binary directory (if it exists or can be created)
4. `$HOME/.opencode/bin` - Default fallback

```bash
# Examples
OPENCODE_INSTALL_DIR=/usr/local/bin curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash
XDG_BIN_DIR=$HOME/.local/bin curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash
```

### Agents

OpenCode includes two built-in agents you can switch between with the `Tab` key.

- **build** - Default, full-access agent for development work
- **plan** - Read-only agent for analysis and code exploration
  - Denies file edits by default
  - Asks permission before running bash commands
  - Ideal for exploring unfamiliar codebases or planning changes

Also included is a **general** subagent for complex searches and multistep tasks.
This is used internally and can be invoked using `@general` in messages.

### Contributing

### Building on OpenCode

If you are working on a project that's related to OpenCode and is using "opencode" as part of its name, for example "opencode-dashboard" or "opencode-mobile", please add a note to your README to clarify that it is not built by the OpenCode team and is not affiliated with us in any way.

### FAQ

#### How is this different from Claude Code?

It's very similar to Claude Code in terms of capability. Here are the key differences:

- 100% open source
- Not coupled to any provider. Although we recommend the models we provide through [OpenCode Zen](https://opencode.ai/zen), OpenCode can be used with Claude, OpenAI, Google, or even local models. As models evolve, the gaps between them will close and pricing will drop, so being provider-agnostic is important.
- Out-of-the-box LSP support
- A focus on TUI. OpenCode is built by neovim users and the creators of [terminal.shop](https://terminal.shop); we are going to push the limits of what's possible in the terminal.
- A client/server architecture. This, for example, can allow OpenCode to run on your computer while you drive it remotely from a mobile app, meaning that the TUI frontend is just one of the possible clients.
